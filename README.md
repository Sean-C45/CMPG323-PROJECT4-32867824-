# CMPG323-PROJECT4-32867824-
This repository will be used for project 4 of the user acceptance testing using UIPath to test the user input data on the web application that was created in project 3


      PROJECT USAGE
the solution would only require data, and the entered data would then be shown to be valid(True) or not valid(False), Saving testers a huge amount of time doing the same task of entering data again and again.
